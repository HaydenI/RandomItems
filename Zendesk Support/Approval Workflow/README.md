Many apps in the Zendesk app store charge based on agent count. For example, lets say you have 600 agents and the app wants $10 a head per month. That is $6k per month. Even though not all 600 agents will be using it. Which made me think, how can I accomplish what those apps do but build it with applications I already have access to.
